# ThreeWordSequenceCounter

ThreeWordSequenceCounter is Java Command Line application that counts every 3 word sequence in a text file and outputs
the 100 most common sequences. The program uses Java's multi-threading capabilities to load data into a Queue in 1
thread while reading from the Queue and populating a HashMap of each 3 word sequence in another thread. After all input
has been processed, the top 100 values from the HashMap are printed to stdout in order from highest to 100th highest.

If multiple files are passed to the application, they are processed in the order they were passed and the top 100
sequences from each file are printed.

## Installation

Install by running the following commands from your Terminal (Note: Java JDK must be installed first to compile code)

```
cd *directory of source files*
javac ThreeWordSequenceCounter.java
```

## Usage
ThreeWordSequenceCounter can be run by passing in one or more filenames, reading input from a file passed through stdin,
or manually entering text into the application.
 
Examples:

* Passing in filenames (All files must be in the same directory as the ThreeWordSequenceCounter application)
```
java ThreeWordSequenceCounter filename1.txt filename2.txt filename3.txt
```
* Reading from stdin
```
cat filename.txt | java ThreeWordSequenceCounter
```
* Manually entering text 
```
java ThreeWordSequenceCounter
text line 1
text line 2
text line 3
...
text line n
Ctrl+D to end input
```

## Known Issues
* Text passed through stdin is ignored if a file is passed as an argument. Ex:
```
cat filename.txt | java ThreeWordSequenceCounter filename2.txt
```
